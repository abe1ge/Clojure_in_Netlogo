### Bugs
becarful of what you ask for, 
its easy to unsync the read and write of both componenets so when you are asking for something, wait for a reply otherwise you could be waiting for ever.

also it hasn't happended to me yet but i suspect if used enough time, stack overflow is inevtable, don't know how to go about this
if u know the fix, do one of those pull push things with git hub
